# What I Do

In my dissertation, I comprehensively described and analyzed the library of the Christian Hebraist Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter (1507-1557). To this end, I worked with the analytical techniques of paleography and codicology of Hebrew manuscripts. I also wanted to contribute to the history of libraries and the history of the Jewish book in the hands of Christian Hebraists in the 16th century. Another part of my dissertation is Widmanstetter's interest in Kabbalah. You can learn about this project from by book [*Confronting Kabbalah: Studies in the Christian Hebraist Library of Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter*](https://brill.com/display/title/60360).

As part of my work on a DFG project on [R. Moses Zacuto](https://kabbalaheditions.org/zacuto/about.html) at the University of Halle-Wittenberg, I have also been working on modern Jewish correspondence and in particular the materiality of this medium since 2018. In both of these projects, I have used digital humanities methods for analyses and text-critical editions. 

In the project ["MAJLIS. The Transformation of Jewish Literature in Arabic in the Islamic World"](https://www.naher-osten.uni-muenchen.de/forschung/majlis/index.html), I draw on these experiences and have designed (with Winona Salesky) a platform to cataloging manuscripts into TEI-format inside a browser and I have worked on the libraries of Konstantin von Tischendorf and Moses W. Shapira (both publications forthcoming).
