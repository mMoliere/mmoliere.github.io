The aim of the ERC-funded project "MAJLIS. The Transformation of Jewish Literature in Arabic in the Islamic World", is to make Arabic-language Jewish literature produced in the eleventh century at the Karaite academy in Jerusalem accessible in the form of a database. To this end, manuscripts, persons, works, places and relationships are to be cataloged. For the project, the researchers decided to use the leading TEI-XML standard in the digital humanities. In doing so, they endeavored to retain their own terminology and working methods without having to work directly with TEI code. 

Together with Winona Salesky, I  developed a tool that is geared towards the needs of our research team. The result is manuForma - an innovative tool that not only simplifies the cataloging of manuscripts in a web browser, but also makes it intuitive and customizable. ManuForma supports the researchers in creating consistent data records with various tools in the user interface, without the need for TEI knowledge.

manuForma is accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/majlis-erc/manuForma/).
